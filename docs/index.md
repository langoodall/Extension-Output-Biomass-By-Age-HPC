# What is the Biomass-By-Age Output Extension?

This extension summarizes output from any biomass-compatible extensions, including NECN, PnET, and Biomass Succession. Biomass data is summarized and mapped by species age classes.  This is particularly useful when it's important to understand how biomass is changing by age-class.  For example, how much aboveground biomass is there for all young pines?  For all oaks older than maturity?  For all old-growth (> 80 year) Doug-fir?
